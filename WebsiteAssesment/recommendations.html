            <h3>20" Paiste Power Ride Alpha</h3>
            <img src="images/PowerRideAlpha.jpeg" alt="Power Ride Alpha" class="img-border drumkit-img">
            <p>The Paiste Alpha series are considered to be some of the best cymbals when it comes to a balance of sound and price, they sound professional 
                whilst remaining within the budget of most drummer. The 20" Power Ride is a great option from the alpha series if your looking for a powerful
                ride that can cut through the mix of a band. the alpha series was discontinued in 2017 but used cymbals are still around. They were replaced
                with the 900 series which is another great option if your looking for afforadble cymbals that sound great.
                It has a bright, clear sound with a strong ping and a defined bell, making it perfect for rock
                and metal music. Its durability and affordability make it a great choice for drummers of all skill levels. I personally use the power ride
                in my main kit as it is one of the best cymbals I have ever played in that price range.</p>

            <h3>Meinl HCS Cymbal Set</h3>
            <img src="images/MeinlHCSfull.jpg" alt="Meinl HCS Cymbal Set" class="img-border drumkit-img-left">
            <p>The Meinl HCS Cymbal Set is one of the most versatile sets for beginners from any brand. They are by no means good cymbals
                but they are a great very cheap option for any beginners looking to get into drumming. They have lots of diffrent sets available
                with the biggest one containing up to 20 cymbals. The HCSs are great for beginners as most dont know the diffrence between expensive
                and cheap cymbals and these are a great way to get started without breaking the bank. They are made from brass which is a cheaper metal
                than bronze which is what most professional cymbals are made from. This means that they are not as durable or have as good of a sound
                as more expensive cymbals, but they are still a great option for beginners.
