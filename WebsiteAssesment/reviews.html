            <h3>DW R40 Drum Kit</h3>
            <img src="images/DWr40RUSH.jpg" alt="nealPeartDrumkit" class="img-border drumkit-img-left">
            <p>
                This is the legendary DW R40 drum kit of Late Great Neil Peart, the iconic drummer of Rush. Crafted from rare 1,500-year-old Romanian River Oak, this custom 
                kit was designed in close collaboration with DW to celebrate Rush's 40th anniversary. Featuring intricate wood inlays and premium gold-plated 
                hardware, it's as much a work of art as it is a powerful instrument. Known for its rich, warm tone and exceptional craftsmanship, the R40 perfectly
                 suited Neil's precise and dynamic playing style. This one-of-a-kind setup not only honors his legacy but also stands as one of the most unique and
                 valuable drum kits in the world. Due to the ancient relic wood used in its construction, the kit is likely one of the most expensive in the world,
                 the drum kit alone likely costs around AUD $50,000 and the river oak likely cost upwards of AUD $40,000. The total estimated price is likely above $100,00
